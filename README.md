Space Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a ship with lasers by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat the aliens that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance towards the bottom of the screen. 

The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. If aliens reach the bottom, the invasion is successful and the game ends.


## Controls

* **Movement** - Left & Right Arrow Keys
* **Laser** - Space Bar
